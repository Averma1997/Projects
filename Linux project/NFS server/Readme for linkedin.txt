ðŸ”¹ Assigned NIS domain name rhce using nisdomainname and updated /etc/sysconfig/network with:

ini

Edit
NETWORKING=yes  
HOSTNAME=server  
NISDOMAIN=rhce
ðŸ”¹ Installed YP (NIS) packages using yum, started and enabled the ypserv service with systemctl.
ðŸ”¹ Disabled firewall to allow NIS traffic.
ðŸ”¹ Initialized NIS server using /usr/lib64/yp/ypinit -m.
ðŸ”¹ Installed and configured NFS server for home directory sharing.
ðŸ”¹ Started and enabled NFS service using systemctl.
ðŸ”¹ Configured exports file for sharing directories.
ðŸ”¹ Switched to the client machine, verified network configuration and IP.
ðŸ”¹ Set the client to use the server for NIS authentication, disabled SELinux, and restarted the client.
