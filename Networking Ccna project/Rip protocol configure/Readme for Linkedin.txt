🔧 Today, I successfully configured a RIP (Routing Information Protocol) network topology as part of my CCNA practice.

📌 Step-by-step overview:

Designed a network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer with 3 routers, 3 switches, and 12 PCs.

Attached WIC-1T serial interfaces to all three routers for inter-router connections.

Connected:

Router 1 Serial 0/2/0 (DCE) to Router 2 Serial 0/3/0 (DTE)

Router 2 Serial 0/2/0 (DCE) to Router 3 Serial 0/2/0 (DTE)

Used straight-through cables to connect:

Router FastEthernet 0/0 to Switch FastEthernet 0/1

Switch to 4 PCs each on all 3 switches

Configured all devices with correct IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways.

🖥 Router 1 Configuration:

Renamed the router

Assigned IP: 20.0.0.1/8 on Serial 0/2/0, set clock rate to 64000, bandwidth to 64, and brought interface up

Assigned IP: 10.0.0.1/8 on FastEthernet 0/0 and enabled interface

Verified using show ip interface brief

🖥 Router 2 Configuration:

Assigned IP: 20.0.0.2/8 on Serial 0/2/0

Assigned IP: 30.0.0.1/8 on FastEthernet 0/0

Assigned IP: 40.0.0.1/8 on Serial 0/3/0 with clock rate and bandwidth

Enabled all interfaces and verified with show ip interface brief

🖥 Router 3 Configuration:

Renamed router to R3

Assigned IP: 40.0.0.2/8 on Serial 0/2/0

Assigned IP: 50.0.0.1/8 on FastEthernet 0/0

Enabled interfaces and verified configuration

🧑‍💻 PC Configuration:

Assigned static IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways on all 12 PCs

Verified connectivity using ping from each PC — all successful

📡 RIP Routing Configuration:

On Router 1, entered RIP config mode:
router rip
Added networks: 10.0.0.0, 20.0.0.0, 30.0.0.0, 40.0.0.0, 50.0.0.0

Repeated the same RIP network configuration on Router 2 and Router 3

Used show ip route to verify that routing tables were correctly populated

✅ Final Test:

Performed end-to-end ping tests from Router 1 to all networks

Full connectivity achieved

📘 Conclusion:
This hands-on RIP protocol configuration deepened my understanding of dynamic routing and inter-network communication in a multi-router environment.
