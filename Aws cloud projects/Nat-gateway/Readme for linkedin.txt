:
ğŸš€ Today, I built an AWS project using NAT Gateway to enable secure internet access for private EC2 instances.
ğŸ”¹ First, I created a VPC named vpc-nat with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16.
ğŸ”¹ Then, created two subnets:
â€ƒâ€ƒğŸ“Œ Public Subnet â€“ CIDR 10.0.0.0/24, AZ ap-south-1a
â€ƒâ€ƒğŸ“Œ Private Subnet â€“ CIDR 10.0.1.0/24, AZ ap-south-1a
ğŸ”¹ Added an Internet Gateway, attached it to the VPC.
ğŸ”¹ Created a Public Route Table, added route 0.0.0.0/0 â†’ IGW, and associated with the public subnet.
ğŸ”¹ Created a Private Route Table and associated it with the private subnet.
ğŸ”¹ Deployed a NAT Gateway in the public subnet with an Elastic IP.
ğŸ”¹ Created two EC2 instances:
â€ƒâ€ƒğŸ’» Public Instance: Windows AMI, public IP enabled, RDP access enabled.
â€ƒâ€ƒğŸ’» Private Instance: Windows AMI, no public IP, all traffic allowed in SG.
ğŸ”¹ Connected to the public instance via RDP, disabled firewall, and verified private instance access via RDP from inside.
âœ… Successfully implemented secure private instance access using NAT Gateway!
